# Question 2
## Overview
The Python program contains a function that receives a list with positive integers. The function returns the same list sorted by even numbers in descending order and then by odd numbers in ascending order.

### Running
Choose the best form to run the .py file, one form will be explored here.

### IDLE
Download the .py file and run it in your computer (make sure you have Python installed). From the Python Shell, you can test the function using different approaches:

``` python
fun([8,6,43,5,16,4,1,3])
```

``` python
list_1 = [1,6,9,3,4,5,25,2]
fun(list_1)
```
Example:

``` python
fun([1,2,3,4,5,6])
[6,4,2,1,3,5]
```
